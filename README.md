Hi everyone, I am Mohammad Faraji. This is my Modbus ASCII library. here is the first version. Here we don't support RTOS or such OS like that but i hope in next versions, I add this property to it.
If you have any questions about working with this library, you can email me with: amirmohamad14.faraji@gmail.com.
Why i wrote this library?
I couldn't understand the existing librarys. Some of them were so complex and difficult to use, some of them were deficient. So i desided to write my own library which is easy to understand, easy to use and easy to upgrade.
